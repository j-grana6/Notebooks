Literature Review</A>
</H2>
Recent literature on Bertrand competition has taken two
approaches.  The first approach is to extend the game of perfect
observability  to understand other
phenomenon.  For example, [<A
 HREF="node6.html#AB">1</A>] model a Bertrand game in which
each firm's per-unit <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">cost</SPAN> dynamics are described by a two-state Markov
chain.  They show that there exists an equilibrium  where all
firms charge the reserve price in every period, regardless of their
per-unit cost.  Again, note that the firms' pricing decisions are
fully observable.

<P>
Another example with perfectly observable prices is
[<A
 HREF="node6.html#differentialresource">3</A>].  This is a differential game in
which players must also consume a renewable resource.  Also note that
in this game, the demand function is linear and not a reserve price.
Nevertheless, the demand function and the parameters are known exactly
to the players.  The authors then show that a collusive equilibrium
exists (although collusion was not the main focus of their paper).
Again, this is a game with <SPAN  CLASS="textit">no</SPAN> uncertainty.

<P>
The second approach in extending Bertrand games is with secret price
cuts.  That is, players do <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> observe the action of the other
players in the previous rounds.  Instead,  stochastic
profits are realized in each period and firms base their continuation strategy off of
such a signal.  For example, [<A
 HREF="node6.html#greenold">4</A>] shows that there exists a
collusive equilibrium in which players play the collusive price if the
total profit of everyone is greater than a certain constant and then
revert to marginal cost pricing for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img15.png"
 ALT="$ T$"></SPAN> periods if the sum total
of profits is below <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="11" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img27.png"
 ALT="$ c$"></SPAN>, and then return.  In other words, there is a
finite punishment period in which the players cut prices.  

<P>
Other work such as [<A
 HREF="node6.html#powercomm">5</A>] and [<A
 HREF="node6.html#commandcoll">2</A>] show how
there exist information sharing mechanisms that facilitate collusion.
For example, after each period firms may have an incentive to share
their private profit information.  For example, if firms profits are
correlated, each has an incentive to truthfully announce their profits
because if they announce profits that are ``far away'' from their
opponent, the opponent will think they are lying and therefore enter a
punishment phase.  Again, these models assume <SPAN  CLASS="textit">private</SPAN> profit
and pricing information.

<P>
Note the difference between the two approaches to the repeated
Bertrand game.  One is where all information is known and observable
(demand, prices, profits, etc) and the other is when firms receive a
signal that is correlated with both demand and the other player's
prices.  That is, firms can choose to undercut the market but they run
the risk of their signal being too strong.  The event-driven framework
falls into the second category of secrete price cuts.  However, the
nature of the ``correlation'' between prices and information is
different.  In the event-driven framework, a player can undercut the
market without generating <SPAN  CLASS="textit">any</SPAN> signal to the other players.  The
reason is that in the event-driven framework, the players observe
their opponents prices subject to a stochastic lag.  That is, if
player <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$ i$"></SPAN> under undercuts the market at time <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img28.png"
 ALT="$ t$"></SPAN>, player <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img20.png"
 ALT="$ j$"></SPAN> might
not find out about the undercut until time <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="38" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img29.png"
 ALT="$ t+\tau$"></SPAN>.  However, neither
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$ i$"></SPAN> nor <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="12" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img20.png"
 ALT="$ j$"></SPAN> know <SPAN  CLASS="textit">exactly</SPAN> when prices will be made public.
Therefore, it might be optimal for <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$ i$"></SPAN> to undercut the market for a
fixed amount of time and then, after realizing he has not been caught,
return to the collusive price.  In other words, players in the
event-driven Bertrand model do not focus on <SPAN  CLASS="textit">what</SPAN> their
information tells them about the other player's strategies but
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">when</SPAN> they will receive information about other player's
strategies.

<P>
Although this will be made clearer in the following section, in the
event-driven Bertrand model, the players almost always do not know
demand or the other players' price.  They only observe signals in
sporadic intervals and there is no restriction that players must learn
of a change immediately after it happens.  In other words, the
event-driven Bertrand game is a new version of secret price cuts
(in which players are not apprised of the exact state of demand or
other players' prices).
