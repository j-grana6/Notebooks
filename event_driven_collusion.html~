<!--l. 10--><p class="noindent" >This write-up is intended to be the &#8220;white paper&#8221; to an Econometrica, AER,
JET...submission. It will begin with a brief introduction that outlines a Bertrand
game and the notion of collusion. It will then briefly outline some of the foundational
as well as more current literature that investigate collusion in a Bertrand
environment. Finally the introduction will clearly juxtapose an event-driven Bertrand
game with the current literature.
<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >   The second section will outline the model in terms of an SFT-Net. It omits the
fully rigorous specification of the network in favor of an intuitive explanation with
the requisite notation. Note that this section also omits the &#8220;one step deviation
principal&#8221; for event-driven games as well as the notion of subgame perfect/sequential
equilibrium. Basically, all of this involves a &#8220;translation&#8221; of the idea of subgame
perfect/sequential equilibrium in repeated games to an event-driven framework. It is
a ton of tedious mathematical boilerplate but conceptually very simple. (On
another note, it might make sense to describe something like an &#8220;event-driven
equilibrium&#8221; that is similar to subgame perfect. For example, we can say something
like &#8220;If all players&#8217; internal state includes a component that represents the
entire history of past observations, then for all players <span 
class="cmmi-10">i </span>and histories <span 
class="cmmi-10">h</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">i</span></sub>, <span 
class="cmmi-10">i</span>
cannot improve his expected utility by deviating, the strategy profile is an
event-driven equilibrium. I&#8217;m sure there will be some gotchyas but the intuition is
there.)
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   The third section will present the results and discuss extensions and future
work.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1   </span> <a

<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmti-10">This just outlines the basic static and repeated Bertrand game. Can be skipped if you</span>
<span 
class="cmti-10">are familiar with &#8220;trigger strategies&#8221; </span>The standard, static Bertrand example is as
follows: Suppose there are <span 
class="cmmi-10">I </span>= <span 
class="cmsy-10">{</span>1<span 
class="cmmi-10">,</span>2<span 
class="cmsy-10">} </span>firms. Each firm has identical per-unit cost <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B8;</span>.
Firm <span 
class="cmmi-10">i </span>chooses a price, <span 
class="cmmi-10">p</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">i</span></sub> in <span 
class="msbm-10">&#x211D;</span>. Suppose there is a continuum of consumers on the
interval [0<span 
class="cmmi-10">,</span>1] with reservation price <span 
class="cmmi-10">r &#x003E; &#x03B8;</span>. Then, player <span 
class="cmmi-10">i</span>&#8217;s utility function is given
by

As is standard, the only equilibrium in this game is when <span 
class="cmmi-10">p</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">i</span></sub> = <span 
class="cmmi-10">p</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">j</span></sub> = <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B8;</span>. This is easy to
see since any equilibrium with <span 
class="cmmi-10">p</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">i</span></sub><span 
class="cmmi-10">,p</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">j</span></sub> <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x003E; &#x03B8;</span>, firms have the incentive to undercut one
another by a tiny amount (from here an throughout, I will assume that firm <span 
class="cmmi-10">i </span>can
undercut a competitor who charges <span 
class="cmmi-10">p</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">j</span></sub> by charging <span 
class="cmmi-10">p</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">j</span></sub> <span 
class="cmsy-10">- </span><span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03F5; </span>but the profits are still
computed as <span 
class="cmmi-10">p</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">j</span></sub> <span 
class="cmsy-10">- </span><span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B8;</span>.
<!--l. 58--><p class="indent" >   Of course, when the game is repeated in discrete time, the result change. First,
suppose that the Bertrand game is repeated for a known and finite amount of time,
<span 
class="cmmi-10">T</span>, and each player has common discount rate <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B4;</span>. Now, player&#8217;s strategies are
mappings from histories, <span 
class="cmmi-10">h</span>, (all observations of past actions) to next action. Define
the &#8220;finite trigger strategy&#8221; for player <span 
class="cmmi-10">i </span>as <span 
class="cmmi-10">a</span><sub><span 
class="cmmi-7">i</span></sub>(<span 
class="cmmi-10">h</span>) = &#8220;play <span 
class="cmmi-10">r </span>in every period unless <span 
class="cmmi-10">j</span>
does not play <span 
class="cmmi-10">r</span>. In that case, play <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B8; </span>forever.&#8221; It can be shown that this is <span 
class="cmti-10">not </span>a
(symmetric) Nash equilibrium strategy. To see why, note that in period <span 
class="cmmi-10">T</span>,
player <span 
class="cmmi-10">i </span>will want to undercut <span 
class="cmmi-10">j </span>since he does not receive any future benefit
from not undercutting <span 
class="cmmi-10">j</span>. Knowing this, in period <span 
class="cmmi-10">T </span><span 
class="cmsy-10">- </span>1, <span 
class="cmmi-10">j </span>would no longer
have an incentive not to undercut <span 
class="cmmi-10">i</span>. This logic can be extrapolated back to
period 1 and therefore the only Nash equilibrium is when both players charge
<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B8;</span>.
<!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >   Now, suppose the game is repeated infinitely and extend the finite trigger strategy
to an infinite trigger strategy. We will now show that under a high enough discount
rate, the infinite trigger strategy is a subgame perfect equilibrium. To see why, note
that <span 
class="cmmi-10">i</span>&#8217;s total discounted utility under the trigger strategy (played by both players) is
given by <img 
src="event_driven_collusion1x.png" alt="--r--
2(1-&#x03B4;)"  class="frac" align="middle">. Note that if <span 
class="cmmi-10">i </span>undercuts <span 
class="cmmi-10">j</span>, then his expected utility is given by <span 
class="cmmi-10">r</span>
since he gets the entire market share in the first period and then nothing after.

Therefore, <span 
class="cmmi-10">i </span>has an incentive to undercut <span 
class="cmmi-10">j </span>in the first period iff <span 
class="cmmi-10">r &#x003E;</span> <img 
src="event_driven_collusion2x.png" alt="--r--
2(1-&#x03B4;)"  class="frac" align="middle"> or
equivalently <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B4; &#x003C;</span> <img 
src="event_driven_collusion3x.png" alt="1
2"  class="frac" align="middle">. We can also show that this is subgame perfect since if <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B4; &#x003E;</span> <img 
src="event_driven_collusion4x.png" alt="1
2"  class="frac" align="middle">,
given one player has deviated, it is weakly dominant for each player to charge
<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B8;</span>.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-30001.2"></a>Literature Review</h4>
<!--l. 88--><p class="noindent" >Recent literature on Bertrand competition has taken a two-pronged approach. The
first approach is to extend the game of perfect observability of the other player&#8217;s
price to understand other phenomenon. For example, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XAB">1</a>]</span> model a Bertrand game in
which each firm&#8217;s per-unit cost dynamics are described by a two-state Markov chain.
They show that there exists an equilibrium where all firms charge the reserve price in
every period, regardless of their per-unit cost. Again, note that the firms&#8217; pricing
decisions are fully observable.
<!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   Another example with perfectly observable prices is <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xdifferentialresource">3</a>]</span>. This game is a differential
game in which player&#8217;s must also consume a renewable resource. Also note
that in this game, the demand function is linear and not a reserve price.
Nevertheless, the demand function and the parameters are known exactly to the
players. The authors then show that a collusive equilibrium exists (although
collusion was not the main focus of their paper). Again, this is a game with <span 
class="cmti-10">no</span>
uncertainty.
<!--l. 107--><p class="indent" >   The second approach in extending Bertrand games is with secret price cuts. That
is, players do <span 
class="cmti-10">not </span>observe the action of the other player in the previous round.
Instead, after each period stochastic profits are realized and firms base their
continuation strategy off of such a signal. For example, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xgreenold">4</a>]</span> shows that there exists a
collusive equilibrium in which players play the collusive price if the total profit of
everyone is greater than a certain constant and then play revert to marginal cost
pricing for <span 
class="cmmi-10">T </span>periods if the sum total of profits is below <span 
class="cmmi-10">c</span>, and then return. In
other words, there is a finite punishment period in which the players cut
prices.
<!--l. 118--><p class="indent" >   Other work such as <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xpowercomm">5</a>]</span> and <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xcommandcoll">2</a>]</span> show how there exist information sharing
mechanisms that facilitate collusion. For example, after each period firms may have
an incentive to share their private profit information. For example, if firms profits are
correlated, each has an incentive to truthfully announce their profits because if they
announce profits that are &#8220;far away&#8221; from their opponent, the opponent will think
they are lying and therefore enter a punishment phase. Again, these models assume
<span 
class="cmti-10">private </span>profit and pricing information.
<!--l. 128--><p class="indent" >   Note the difference between the two approaches to the repeated Bertrand game.
One is where all information is known and observable (demand, prices, profits, etc)
and the other is when firms receive a signal that is correlated with both demand and
the other player&#8217;s prices. That is, firms can choose to undercut the market but they
run the risk of their signal being too strong. The event-driven framework falls into
the second category of secrete price cuts. However, the nature of the &#8220;correlation&#8221;
between prices and information is different. In the event-driven framework, a player

can undercut the market without generating <span 
class="cmti-10">any </span>signal to the other players.
The reason is that in the event-driven framework, the players observe their
opponents prices subject to a stochastic lag. That is, if player <span 
class="cmmi-10">i </span>under undercuts
the market at time <span 
class="cmmi-10">t</span>, player <span 
class="cmmi-10">j </span>might not find out about the undercut until
time <span 
class="cmmi-10">t </span>+ <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03C4;</span>. However, neither <span 
class="cmmi-10">i </span>nor <span 
class="cmmi-10">j </span>know <span 
class="cmti-10">exactly </span>when prices will be made
public. Therefore, it might be optimal for <span 
class="cmmi-10">i </span>to undercut the market for a fixed
amount of time and then, after realizing he has not been caught, return to
the collusive price. In other words, players in the event-driven Bertrand
model do not focus on <span 
class="cmti-10">what </span>their information tells them about the other
player&#8217;s strategies but <span 
class="cmti-10">when </span>they will receive information about other player&#8217;s
strategies.
<!--l. 151--><p class="indent" >   Although this will be made clearer in the following section, in the event-driven
Bertrand model, almost always the players do not know demand or the other player&#8217;s
price. They only observe signals in sporadic intervals and there is no restriction that
players must learn of a change immediately after it happens. In other words,
the event-driven Bertrand game is a new version of secret price cuts (in
which players are not apprised of the exact state of demand or other players&#8217;
prices).
<!--l. 165--><p class="noindent" >
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-40002"></a>Model</h3>
<!--l. 166--><p class="noindent" >There is a market node whose state space consists of <span 
class="cmsy-10">{</span><span class="underline">r</span><span 
class="cmmi-10">,</span><span class="overline"><span 
class="cmmi-10">r</span></span><span 
class="cmsy-10">} </span>(as well as the prices of
each firm&#8217;s product). The market changes states spontaneously at rate <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B3;</span>. Intuitively,
there are two reserve prices. The market alternates between these reserve prices at
rate <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03B3;</span>. At rate <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03BB;</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-7">1</span></sub>, the market emits a message that travels instantaneously to player
1 that informs player 1 of the reserve price. This message is noiseless. At a
rate of <span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03BB;</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-7">2</span></sub>, the market does the same but the message is directed to player
2.
<!--l. 176--><p class="indent" >   When player, <span 
class="cmmi-10">i </span>= 1<span 
class="cmmi-10">,</span>2 receives a message, he must make two decisions. First, he
must decide what price to charge in <span 
class="msbm-10">&#x211D;</span><sup><span 
class="cmr-7">+</span></sup>. Secondly, he can decide whether or not
to send a message to player 2, indicating what message he just received.
The players are not restricted to telling the truth and the message to the
other player is costless. In other words, the players can engage in cheap
talk.
<!--l. 183--><p class="indent" >   The rewards for player <span 
class="cmmi-10">i </span>given his price is <span

<!--l. 192--><p class="nopar" >
In other words, the players split the market if they both charge below the reward
price and charge the same price. If the players charge two different prices, the player
with the lowest price captures the entire market. If player <span 
class="cmmi-10">i </span>is undercut or is charging
above the reserve price, then he earns zero reward. Here I normalize per unit cost to
0. Therefore, the term &#8220;marginal cost pricing&#8221; will be referred to the case when a
firm charges 0.
<!--l. 201--><p class="indent" >   Finally, the market sends messages to player 1 and player 2 simultaneously at rate
<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x03BC; </span>and those messages traverse instantaneously. The messages reveal the price of each
player&#8217;s product currently in the market. Upon receiving the public message, each
player can decide to either revert to marginal cost pricing or maintain its current
price.
<!--l. 208--><p class="indent" >   There are a ton of assumptions built into this model. Without explaining, I just
want to enumerate which ones can be relaxed.

players in the market is the same, take no action. Upon receiving a public message
that the prices of the two firms in the market are <span

forever
<!--l. 248--><p class="indent" >   Intuitively, the truthful information sharing strategy is one in which all
