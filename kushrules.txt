Keepers
-------

* Every team *must* keep 4 players.  Contrary to ESPN rules, not keeping all 4 players results in a loss of draft pick and you do *not* get a pick in place of not selecting a keeper

* Every team *may* keep two farm players in addition to their 4 keepers.  For a player to be kept as a farm keeper they must meet the following requirements:
  * No more than 275 at bats in a single season for any hitter
  * No more than 15 games started in a single season for an SP
  * No more than 30 relief appearances in a single season for an RP

* Farm keepers are to be drafted in the last two rounds of the draft.  If someone accidentally drafts another team's farm keeper, the person who drafted the player must drop the player immediately after the draft

Position Limits
---------------

* Teams are limited to 9 pitching games started per week.  This is a standard ESPN rule but it should be noted for newcomers that ESPN does not always lock pitchers when the limit is reached.  There is a penalty in terms of negative points for going over the pitching limit.

* Relief pitchers with dual SP and RP eligibility cannot be used in an SP slot

* Outfielders cannot be used in the utility slot.  Only infielders, catchers and DH players can be used in the utility slot.  However, players with OF and DH eligibility are NOT eligible for the utility slot

Other
-----

* Kush does not allow trade vetos

* There will  be no off-season free agent acquisitions. This would apply to a scenario such as when Tanaka signed with the Yankees in the summer a few years ago. This section of the Majka Rukle that we are keeping prevents any owner from acquiring him as a free agent and he must be left for the draft. Pretty straight forward.

However, we are now allowed to make off-season trades of our rostered players and draft picks. This trade activity is allowed up until rosters clear at the keeper deadline. This activity must take place once the entire season ends and trade deadline impositions are moot. It cannot take place between the trade deadline date and the end of the World Series. It may resume the second the WS ends and must end by the keeper deadline for next season.

* Draft pick trading is allowed.  Any trade involving a draft pick must be posted on the league message board and it is the responsibility of the teams that traded to make sure the trade is executed during the draft
